# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent 🤖❌⭕  

An unbeatable **Tic-Tac-Toe AI** implemented using the **Minimax algorithm**, allowing a human player to compete against an optimal AI opponent. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of **game theory**, **search algorithms**, and **decision-making in AI**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a classic **Human vs AI Tic-Tac-Toe game** where the AI agent always plays optimally.  
Using the Minimax algorithm, the AI evaluates all possible future game states and selects the best possible move, ensuring it **never loses**.

---

## 🧠 AI Algorithm Used

### Minimax Algorithm
- Explores all possible game states recursively
- Maximizes the AI player's outcome
- Minimizes the human player's chances of winning
- Guarantees optimal play

**Result:**  
✔ AI always wins or draws  
❌ AI never loses

## 🎮 Game Rules

- Human Player will choose X or O
- then AI will choose other

- Board positions are numbered from 0 to 8
